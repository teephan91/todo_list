## Installation & Set Up

1. You have to fork this repo first. Github has a their own [step-by-step guide with pictures to follow along](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).

- **Note**: You have the option of changing the name of your forked repo.

2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:

```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/todo_list.git
```

- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'todo_list.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.

3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.

```
cd todo_list
```

or

```
cd [your-forked-repo-name]
```
